# SNAP-Graphs
This repository gathers a number of differnt SNAP graphs.

SNAP is ESA's Sentinel Application Platform. It is a free and open source tool available from http://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/.
Graphs are XML scripts based on Graph Processing Framework (GPF) tools. These graphs are executed with SNAP's Graph Processing Tool (GPT). Basics on GPF and GPT can be found under https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SNAP/pages/70503590/Creating+a+GPF+Graph and https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SNAP/pages/70503475/Bulk+Processing+with+GPT.

An execution example is given on the first line of each graph.
